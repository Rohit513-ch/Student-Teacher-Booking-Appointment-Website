## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A calm blue (#64B5F6) to convey trust and reliability, fitting for an educational setting. This color is used for the primary actions and key elements.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F4F8), a desaturated version of the primary hue, to ensure readability and a clean, modern look.
- Accent color: A soft green (#A5D6A7) is used to indicate availability or success, such as available appointment slots or successfully booked appointments.  It provides a gentle contrast without being overwhelming.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, to provide a modern and easily readable experience.
- Use simple, outline-style icons from a library like Material Icons to maintain a clean and consistent look. Icons should be used to help visually communicate different actions and entities (e.g., a calendar for appointments, a person for profiles).
- Use a grid-based layout to ensure a responsive design that works well on different screen sizes. Prioritize important information with clear visual hierarchy.
- Subtle animations should be used for transitions and interactions (e.g., loading indicators, form validation feedback) to improve the user experience without being distracting.
